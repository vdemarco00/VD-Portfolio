      I have extensive experience with the Unity game engine, C#, C++, Python, and have a general passion for games and computers. 
      Check out some of my work in the <a href="projects.html">projects</a> section of this site, or at my <a href="https://github.com/vdemarco00/">Github</a> page.

    <h2 class="desc1">
      I studied game development at Southern New Hampshire University, and graduated in April 2022. 
      I'm passionate about games, virtual reality, PC hardware, and open-source software.
    </h2>
    <h2 class="desc1">
      I was a part of SNHU's Inkwell Game Studio, and I've worked on several projects for them, 
      such as an interactive archaeology simulation, a JRPG game, a small fishing game prototype, 
      and a 3D platformer game for the Bank of New Hampshire Pavilion. I've been working at Northern Light Productions
      since 2022 as an interactive developer. I've been involved in 6 projects in some capacity (4 of which working on several interactives), 
      leading the development on four of them. 
      
      In my free time I like to play games, tinker with world creation in VRChat, make bad songs, and 
      hang out with my weird cat and dog.
