        <h1>Archaeology Simulation Project</h1>
        <h2>An educational digging/artifact inspecting simulation program for archaeology students.</h2>
        <h3>
            This project was developed for the SNHU Online school, and is intended to be supplemental content for students studying
            archaeology.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            This program realistically simulates digging for artifacts. The user skims their shovel along the dig site to
            slowly reveal what's buried underneath, and sifts through the soil that they dig up to find smaller artifacts.
        </h3>
        <h3>
            The program runs in a web browser to make it accessible to most students. Most of my work on this project was fixing and adjusting unfinished 
            or broken features, and optimizing the project to run on a web browser.
        </h3>
